This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, which attempts to parse a user ID from a route parameter without error checking.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the ID is not a valid integer. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.
